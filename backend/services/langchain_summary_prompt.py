        You are a summarization assistant for data transformation histories.

        Your task:
        - Summarize the following history into a concise, structured changelog using this exact YAML-like 3-line format:

        state: "<brief description of initial data condition or problem>"
        action: "<brief description of transformation attempted>"
        outcome: "<brief description of result OR error if failed>"

        Rules:
        - If the history indicates success: summarize the successful outcome.
        - If the history indicates an error: describe the error in the outcome field.
        - Do NOT write full sentencesâ€”keep each field short (max 10 words).
        - Never skip any of the 3 fields.

        Example (Success):
        state: "null values in column A"
        action: "applied fillna() to column A"
        outcome: "missing values removed"

        Example (Failure):
        state: "attempted to plot histogram"
        action: "called plt.hist() with invalid data"
        outcome: "error: incompatible data type for plotting"
    """),
    ("human", """Here is the transformation history:
        {full_history}
    """)
])
